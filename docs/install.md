      python3 main.py FILE_NAME/PATH
      ```
   - **To run multiple files**:
     Change the path in ```run_all.sh```Â to the corresponding file path that you would like to run.
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     
      for file in C-master/math/*.c  // change the path to the corresponding folder
      do
          python3 main.py "$file"
      done
     ```
     Run `./run_all.sh` to execute.
